# 🧑🏻‍💻 Aspiring Career Shifter: A Veterinary learning to Code 👨🏻‍⚕️
- 👋 Hi, my name is Bê. Nice to meet you! I'm an autistic and transgender person, with Veterinary Medicine degree 🐍🐠🦉🐁 at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. After four years of work, I decided to shift my career. 🎯 I am a highly logical person, who learns quickly and loves to solving problems. So my brother, who is a software developer, introduced me to Programming Logic. And I loved it! 🤩

- 📚 I’m currently learning back-end development (Python and Java) and also front-end development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), but mostly back-end. I’m currently a student at National Service for Commercial Education (SENAC) in Brazil (presentially) and at +praTI Institution, also from Brazil, but remotely. I use Portuguese as native language for the repositories of these courses.
