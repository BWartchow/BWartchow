# 👨🏻‍⚕️ Aspiring Career Shifter: From Veterinary Medicine to Coding 🧑🏻‍💻
- 👋 Hi, my name is Bê. Nice to meet you! I'm autistic and transgender, with a degree in Veterinary Medicine 🐍🐠🦉🐁 from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. After four years in the field, I've decided to pivot my career. 🎯 I am highly logical, learn quickly, and love solving problems. That's why my brother, a software developer, introduced me to Programming Logic. And I absolutely love it! 🤩

- 📚 Currently, I'm learning back-end development (Python and Java) as well as front-end development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), with a focus on front-end.
